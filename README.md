# Why We Built This

In our 270 computer science course at CNU, we were given the task of designing a program that allowed for students to modify and examine a binary tree. Tired of explaining binary trees, we built this to allow for anyone, with minimal to no knowledge of a binary tree, to learn and examine how a binary tree is constructed and modified.

# Build

To use this program you will need at least Java 7 and an installation of git. Open terminal or cmd and type:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Danieth/binarySearchTreeVisualized.git
$ cd binarySearchTreeVisualized
$ javac BstObjPanel.java
$ java BstObjPanel
```
